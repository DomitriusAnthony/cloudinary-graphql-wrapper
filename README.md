# cloudinary-graphql-wrapper
A wrapper for the Cloudinary Node SDK, fed into a graphql endpoint

This is a full stack app showcasing how to begin wrapping the Cloudinary node SDK with Apollo Server. There has also been a UI included to interact with it.

To use this, you'll need to add a `.env` file to the server folder and add your `CLOUD_NAME`, `API_SECRET`, and `API_KEY`
